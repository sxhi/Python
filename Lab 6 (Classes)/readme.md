For this project, you are required to write a class to handle fractions.

You must overload operators +, -, *, / to work with your class, as well as integers.
All output should show the fraction in reduced form (improper fractions are allowed. So, 1 2/3 would be 5/3).
You will need a method to display the fraction as a fraction.  If the fraction has numerator 4 and denominator 7 then it should display as 4/7.
Create a simple menu of operators and ask the user for two fractions then perform that operation on the numbers entered. Repeat until the user quits.
