Q1:

Your input file is the syllabus for this course, found on Canvas under files. You may convert it to text. 
Read the file, counting the number of times each letter (not differentiating between uppercase and lowercase) and number appears (a-z, A-Z, 0-9; 36 total items). 
Display the results as a histogram or bar chart with appropriate title and labels for x-axis and y-axis.

Q2:
The book “Frankenstein”, by Mary Shelly, has been uploaded to files.
Read the entire file and count every word, number, and punctuation mark.
An apostrophe doesn’t count as punctuation – it’s part of the word. 

Report the count frequency results as a histogram or bar chart, reporting the results in ascending sort order.
Include good labels for both axes and a title for the chart. Change the angle of the x-axis values so they are legible. 
There are hundreds of words in the book so create two charts. The first will display the 50 most used words. The second will display the 50 longest words.
