You shall manually create a CSV file to store names and scores.  The file format is last name, first name, score 1, score 2, score 3, score 4.
Scores range from 1-50, or -1 if no score available. Enter at least 7 players into your data file.
Players with one or more -1 scores are disqualified and their names are written to an output file using the format: name “didn’t participate in round(s) “ and list the rounds in which the player did not participate (those with a -1 value). 
Write to a second output file the name and total score (exclude -1 values) of all participants, highest score to lowest score. In case of ties, list tying participants in alphabetical order, by last name then first name.
