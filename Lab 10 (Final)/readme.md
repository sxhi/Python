A currently viral game is wordl.  To play it, a person has six chances to guess a five-letter word.  If a letter is not in the answer, then it will be colored one color. If a letter is in the answer but in the wrong spot, then it will be colored a second color.  
A letter both in the answer and in the correct spot will be colored a third color.

We will not be writing our own version but performing data analysis on all possible solutions. 

Read file answers.txt, which contains all possible five-letter words in the English language. 
The output must be in sorted order: most frequent to least frequent, with ties being in alphabetical order. 

Produce histograms (or other charts you feel would be appropriate) showing frequency of all 26 letters appearing in the words (case doesnâ€™t matter). 
Also, produce five more histograms (or other charts) showing frequency of all 26 letters by position within the words.
