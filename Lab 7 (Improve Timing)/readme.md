Q1. Determine how to time programs in Python.  Run 3 tests of each of the first two solutions and 
average the results.
Come up with a solution that is more efficient (faster). 
Supply your faster algorithm and the average result of all three algorithms.

Q2. Deep dive into logically cutting corners in a solution through analysis. 
Simply do this: find the price of four items who's sum and who's product both equal 7.11.  
So, a+b+c+d == a*b*c*d == 7.11. 
There may be more than one answer. Supply your final algorithm and how long it takes to solve the problem.
